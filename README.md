## Create React App Visualization

So, This test was pretty enjoyable.
 Things I liked (
  Got to test out redux-saga (which was pretty awesome),
  Testing on what the actual job is,
  Options of what you could do based on you level,
  Toastify is nice for handling errors,
  It's always fun to see everything come alive )
Things I didnt like (
  -Nothing **kudos**)


Other then that everything you should find in good working order, the map will need an api key of course. Hopefully you like it and I look forward to talking to you!
